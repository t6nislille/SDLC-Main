<button class="accordion">Behavior-driven development</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>Behavior-driven development (BDD) is an Agile software development methodology in which an application is documented and designed around the behavior a user expects to experience when interacting with it.
    By encouraging developers to focus only on the requested behaviors of an app or program, BDD helps to avoid bloat, excessive code, unnecessary features or lack of focus.
    </p>
</div>

<button class="accordion">Design-driven development</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>Design driven development uses design as part of a process to learn and better define requirements in order to build better, more informed technology solutions. It can also be looked at as a process whereby design and user experience drives the development of a product or software application. This leads to products that people enjoy using and want to tell others about.
    This approach helps identify the main pain points early, come up with significant improvements, and address the issues that could be overlooked otherwise. Timely and accurate changes save our clients time and money.

<button class="accordion">Domain-driven design</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>Domain-driven design is a software design approach focusing on modeling software to match a domain according to input from that domain's experts.[2]
    In terms of object-oriented programming it means that the structure and language of software code should match the business domain. For example, if a software processes loan applications, it might have classes like LoanApplication and Customer, and methods such as AcceptOffer and Withdraw.
    Domain-driven design is predicated on the following goals:
    ●	placing the project's primary focus on the core domain and domain logic.
    ●	basing complex designs on a model of the domain.
    ●	initiating a creative collaboration between technical and domain experts.
    </p>

<button class="accordion">Secure by design</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>Secure by design means that software products and capabilities have been designed to be foundationally secure.
    Alternate security strategies, tactics and patterns are considered at the beginning of a software design, and the best are selected and enforced by the architecture, and they are used as guiding principles for developers. It is also encouraged to use strategic design patterns that have beneficial effects on security, even though those design patterns were not originally devised with security in mind. 
    Secure by Design is increasingly becoming the mainstream development approach to ensure security and privacy of software systems. In this approach, security is considered and built into the system at every layer and starts with a robust architecture design. Security architectural design decisions are based on well-known security strategies, tactics, and patterns defined as reusable techniques for achieving specific quality concerns.

<button class="accordion">Test-driven development</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>Test Driven Development (TDD) is software development approach in which test cases are developed to specify and validate what the code will do. In simple terms, test cases for each functionality are created and tested first and if the test fails then the new code is written in order to pass the test and make code simple and bug-free.
    Test-Driven Development starts with designing and developing tests for every small functionality of an application. TDD framework instructs developers to write new code only if an automated test has failed. This avoids duplication of code. The TDD full form is Test-driven development.
    The simple concept of TDD is to write and correct the failed tests before writing new code (before development). This helps to avoid duplication of code as we write a small amount of code at a time in order to pass tests. (Tests are nothing but requirement conditions that we need to test to fulfill them).
    Test-Driven development is a process of developing and running automated tests before actual development of the application. Hence, TDD is sometimes also called Test First Development.
    </p>
</div>

<button class="accordion">Acceptance test-driven development</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>Analogous to test-driven development, Acceptance Test Driven Development (ATDD) involves team members with different perspectives (customer, development, testing) collaborating to write acceptance tests in advance of implementing the corresponding functionality.  The collaborative discussions that occur to generate the acceptance test are often referred to as the three amigos, representing the three perspectives of the customer (what problem are we trying to solve?), development (how might we solve this problem?), and testing (what about…).
    These acceptance tests represent the user’s point of view and act as a form of requirements to describe how the system will function, as well as serve as a way of verifying that the system functions as intended. In some cases the team automates the acceptance tests.
    </p>
</div>

<button class="accordion">Continuous test-driven development</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>Continuous test-driven development (CTDD) is a software development practice that extends test-driven development (TDD) by means of automatic test execution in the background, sometimes called continuous testing. 
    In CTDD the developer writes a test first but is not forced to execute the tests manually. The tests are run automatically by a continuous testing tool running in the background. This technique can potentially reduce the time waste resulting from manual test execution by eliminating the need for the developer to start the test after each phase of the normal TDD practice: after writing the (initially failing) test, after producing the minimal amount of code for the test to pass and after refactoring the code.
    </p>
</div>

<button class="accordion">Specification by example</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>Specification by example (SBE) is a collaborative approach to defining requirements and business-oriented functional tests for software products based on capturing and illustrating requirements using realistic examples instead of abstract statements. It is applied in the context of agile software development methods, in particular behavior-driven development. This approach is particularly successful for managing requirements and functional tests on large-scale projects of significant domain and organizational complexity.
    Specification by example is intended to construct an accurate understanding, and significantly reduces feedback loops in software development, leading to less rework, higher product quality, faster turnaround time for software changes and better alignment of activities of various roles involved in software development such as testers, analysts and developers.

<button class="accordion">Data-driven development</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>Data-driven software development is based on solid metrics like Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) or Objectives And Key Results (OKRs). Clear, objective, and unambiguous, these metrics encourage dev teams to think about the long-term strategic objectives of their day-to-day work and the business value of each project. The data allows these teams and individuals to visualize how their work contributes to business success, and how they can support the organization in meeting its vital goals.
    Here, it’s important to note that despite its focus on hard numbers and statistics, the success of data-driven development depends on people. A metrics-based program can only succeed if individuals and teams understand the data, engage with it, and are open to leveraging it for continuous learning and improvement.
    The data-driven approach, particularly with well-defined benchmarks, provides greater visibility into in-progress work. This allows each developer to see the impact of their individual effort on overall project success (or failure) and also enables teams to effectively measure the level of success.
    </p>

<button class="accordion">Data-oriented design</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>In computing, data-oriented design is a program optimization approach motivated by efficient usage of the CPU cache, used in video game development.[1] The approach is to focus on the data layout, separating and sorting fields according to when they are needed, and to think about transformations of data. The claim is that traditional object-oriented programming (OOP) design principles result in poor data locality.</p>
